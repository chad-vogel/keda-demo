# Slide 13 – Key Takeaways

## Talking Points

- Serverless and Kubernetes converge through Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA).
- Azure Functions plus KEDA offers a repeatable blueprint for event-driven autoscaling in your own clusters.
- Scaling is only part of the journey—platform enablement, governance, and observability matter just as much.
- Balance flexibility with the operational cost of running the platform yourself.
- Deliver a consistent developer experience that combines velocity with reliability.

## Next Steps

- Identify one candidate workload that could move from manual scaling to KEDA-based triggers.
- Pair application and platform engineers to review the prerequisites listed in the [demo overview](../overview.md).
- Schedule a follow-up session to capture lessons learned and update platform templates accordingly.
