# Slide 14 – Looking Ahead

## Talking Points

- Combine Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA) with Knative or other higher-level platforms to unlock more serverless features.
- Explore predictive scaling to smooth out spikes before they arrive.
- Consider hybrid hosting models that span cloud and edge clusters.
- Build cost governance dashboards and reusable templates so teams launch with confidence.

## Resources to Explore

- [Knative Serving Documentation](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/) – extend autoscaling with routing and revision management.
- [Azure Load Testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/load-testing/overview) – validate predictive scaling assumptions.
- [FinOps Foundation](https://www.finops.org/) – practices for cost governance in cloud-native platforms.
