# Slide 02 – Agenda

## Today's Journey

1. **Foundation** – why serverless matters in cloud-native landscapes.  
2. **Architecture** – Azure Functions triggers, hosting models, and scale controller internals.  
3. **KEDA Deep Dive** – operator components, metrics adapters, and trigger ecosystem.  
4. **Integration** – mapping Azure Functions triggers to Kubernetes scaling rules.  
5. **Patterns** – reusable architectural lessons from real-world workloads.  
6. **Engineering** – latency, cold starts, identity, and scaling ceilings.  
7. **Best Practices** – balancing flexibility, operability, and cost.  
8. **Q&A** – open discussion and experience sharing.

## What Participants Should Learn

- Recognise the core building blocks behind Azure Functions and KEDA.
- Understand when to favour serverless-on-Kubernetes over fully managed Function-as-a-Service offerings.
- Know which follow-up resources dive deeper into triggers, scaling policies, and operational guardrails.
